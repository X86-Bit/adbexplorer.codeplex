Project Description


 This project is having a adb terminal side by side with a explorer window.

What is ADB ?

Adb is short for Android Debug Bridge.

adb can be used to do many things (as many people know) like install .apk's to their phone or tablet (apk is the equivalent of a .msi .exe a setup file) also you can reboot your phone and many developers have made programs that will root the phone or tablet using adb to push and pull files on  and executing scripts. Adb can be setup on many diffrent OS's: OSX, Windows and Linux. 

*Android Debug Bridge (adb) is a versatile command line tool that lets you communicate with an emulator instance or connected Android-powered device. It is a client-server program that includes three components:
A client, which runs on your development machine. You can invoke a client from a shell by issuing an adb command. Other Android tools such as the ADT plugin and DDMS also create adb clients. 
A server, which runs as a background process on your development machine. The server manages communication between the client and the adb daemon running on an emulator or device. 
A daemon, which runs as a background process on each emulator or device instance.* 

Why have i made this project ?

Well because of many reasons, but the main reason is that when you plug your phone into Windows it will come up with a auto play box and that is annoying for me i just want a simple explorer windows with a console with adb integrated with it. Why ? Well because this way you can install form your computer reboot your phone flash kernels and much more.

What will be packaged with it ?

It will be packaged with the adb tool which will self extract (and maybe set it self to be a path in the environmental variables ) and the simple explorer which will be based on the xp explorer design or the Win 8 style which ever (might be 2 style so the user can change it to what they want).
